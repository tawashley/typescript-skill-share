# TypeScript skill share example code

> Supplemental code to skill share

## Getting up and running

* Clone repo
* Run `npm i` inside the repo to grab all dependencies

## Initial TypeScript setup

* Running `npm run build` will run an initial build, compiling all `.ts` and `.tsx` into the `lib/` folder.
* Running `npm run build:watch` will setup a file watcher, which recompiles on file changes

> This project is based off the [TypeScript Babel Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter), the docs from that can be found in [DOCS.md](DOCS.md)
